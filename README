DESCRIPTION OF CHALLENGING ASPECTS
	Our intermedite deliverable contains the core functionality of the database
	used in our website. We considered this to be the riskiest part of the
	project because they are instrumental to the services of our site. A working
	database means that we have written all of the necessary queries and figured
	out how to handle their results. Interacting with the database and the
	relationships between the various tables within it seemed to be the most
	challenging portion of this assignment to our team.
