Add currently reading book:
	On profile pages, another element should be added which displays the book
	the profile's owner is currently reading.  The book can be retrieved with a
	simple Database Query joining the users table and book table and checkign
	for matches.

Google API:
	Retrieve additional information from the service to populate the book info
	page.  If Google API does not work out, then users should be allowed to
	provide additional information (Brief Description, Date of Publication, etc)
	when adding a book on the site.  If the latter is chosen, then the Book
	table in the database would have to be expanded to accomodate the additional
	data.

CSS/Layout:
	While we are happy with our current styling, we think it could be better.
	We will constantly be experimenting with the following until we find
	some combination that just feels natural.
	- Different fonts
	- New background image
	- Different color schemes
	- Improved navigation
	- Restructure of homepage
	- Increased size of tables
	- Switch buttons in friend's list to links (like in the books list)

Book lists:
	Originally, we had planned to add book lists, however we marked it as extra
	during our proposal meeting.  Depending on if everything above gets
	implemented, we would then attempt the book lists.  For the book lists we
	would need:
	- Database:
		- UsersBooks splits into UsersLists and ListsBooks
		- table: UsersLists (id, username, list_id)
		- table: ListsBooks (id, list_id, isbn)
		- table: Lists (id, username, list_name)
	- Homepage:
		- List of books would change to list of book lists
		- Create a new list
		- Modify a list
		- Remove a list
		- View a list
	- Booklist:
		- Displays list of books (like how the homepage displays books now)
		- Add a book to the list
		- Remove a book from the list
		- View the book on the list
